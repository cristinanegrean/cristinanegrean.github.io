Hello everyone.

My name is Cristina, Iâ€™m a software engineer originally from [Cluj-Napoca](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/romania/transylvania/cluj-napoca), Transylvania, currently living and working in The Netherlands. I decided to start a blog. Why did I do that?

At first, I want to systematize my knowledge about various topics on software development. Some of these are patterns of modular architecture, modern web development frameworks, functional programming and web services.
In my view, transforming a set of thoughts into structured posts is a good way for deeply understanding topics.

Next, English is my second language, Hungarian being my main spoken language. I think maintaining a blog will help me become a better technical writer, as well as engage my creativity.

Finally, I want to share my experience. I hope my posts will be interesting for you, so stay tuned.
